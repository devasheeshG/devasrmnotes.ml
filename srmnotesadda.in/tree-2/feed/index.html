Finally we have q3 relationships among men and women. Read the input format for more clarity. Now, Amit wants to calculate the total number of unique marriages he can set between men and women provided the conditions are followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note &#8211; Two person are said to be in a group if they are friends directly or connected through a chain of mutual friends.&lt;br /&gt;
